*** ~Binary Operators ***
    * Take two operands.
    * They can be used to perform mathematical opertions, create logical expressions, perform basic variable 
        assignments.
    * Arithmetic operators -> Operate on numeric values.
    -Addition adds two numeric values.
    -Subtraction -> Subtracts two numeric va.
    -Multiplication -> Multiplies two numeric values.
    -Division -> Divides one numeric value by another.
    -Modulus -> Returns the remainder after division of one numeric value by another.

    * parentheses
        - java dont allow use [].

    * Numeric promotion
        - for two different data types, java promote to the large of the two data types.
        - if one of the values is floating-point, the result will be a floating-point value.
        - for the smaller data types ( byte, short, char ) if they are used with  any binaru operators, they will be promote to int.
        - after all promotions has occured, the result will have the same data types as its operends.
